## Functional example data sets in SUIT space
For more examples see the cerebellar [atlas collection](http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/atlasPackage.htm)
 
#### HCP task data: 

HCP*.nii contain the group activity maps for 186 subjects from the human connectome project (HCP) task data set, which have been individually masked and normalized into SUIT space (for details, see King et al., 2019).
The tasks and contrasts are described in detail in: 

Barch DM, Burgess GC, Harms MP, Petersen SE, Schlaggar BL, Corbetta M, Glasser MF, Curtiss S, Dixit S, Feldt C, Nolan D, Bryant E, Hartley T, Footer O, Bjork JM, Poldrack R, Smith S, Johansen-Berg H, Snyder AZ, Van Essen DC (2013) Function in the human connectome: task-fMRI and individual differences in behavior. *Neuroimage* 80:169-189.

#### Cerebellar finger representation: Wiestler et al. (2011)
Wiestler_2011_motor_z.nii are the z-value of average classification for the movement of individual fingers, which can be used as a functional localiser for the two cerebellar finger representations. For details see:
